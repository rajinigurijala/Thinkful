    "\n",
    "Here we're going to work through a classic Machine Learning problem - digit recognition. This data is referred to as the MNIST dataset, which stands for Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology, and represents probably the most used dataset in the world for advanced machine learning techniques (though the iris dataset would be a close second). Here we're forgoing a more business focused dataset for a few reasons. Firstly, this dataset is the most written about dataset in these topics - you'll easily find other guides using pure TensorFlow or other tools like Theano to solve the same problem with the same class of models. Similarly, you can also easily find several different kinds of neural networks being used to solve this problem. This will be valuable as you try to expand your knowledge of different kinds of layers and combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be building our code off of the examples provided in the Keras documentation, and found in full on its [creator's github](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/examples). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal here will be simple but multifaceted. Overall we are going to use the MNIST dataset and neural networks to classify handwritten numbers as the proper digits. This will be thought of as a multi-class classification problem, specifically with 10 classes (one for each possible digit).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we will use this to teach a few new kinds of neural network compositions, creating three different styles of network and discussing their relative advantages and disadvantages. Through this we will delve a little deeper into neural network theory.\n",

That's great, but not an easy or meaningful dataset on which to directly train a model.

Our first chunk of code after loading the data does this reshaping (with a conditional on the data format).\n",

That is the convolutional layer, a way of searching for a subpattern over the whole of the image. We can chain multiple of these convolutional layers together, with the below example having two.\n",

For each value generated by our convolutional layers, it looks over the grid in _non_-overlapping segments and takes the maximum value of those outputs. It's not the feautres exact location then that matters, but its approximate or relative location. After pooling you will want to flatten the data back out, so that it can be put into dense layers as we did in MLP."

    "However, to do this we have to abandon the sequential model building we've done so far and things can get much more complicated. You have to use recurrent layers and often time distribution (which handles the extra dimension created through the LTSM layer, as a time dimension) to get these things running. You can find an example of a hierarchical recurrent network below (via the link [here](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_hierarchical_rnn.py)). When you get comfortable with networks as they exist in Keras for both convolution and MLP, start exploring recurrence. Note that this will take an even longer time than the previous ones should you choose to run it again."
